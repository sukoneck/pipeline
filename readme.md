### [Pipeline Proof of Concept](https://project.sukoneck.com)

This is the website and Dockerfile used for my continuous delivery pipeline proof of concept project. Resources that were used to help create this code are: 

1. Dockerfile template from [Prakhar Srivastav](https://github.com/prakhar1989/docker-curriculum)

2. CSS template from [Dave Gamache](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton)

3. Modified Dockerfile and removed site wrapper.sh based on [these findings](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18861300/how-to-run-nginx-within-a-docker-container-without-halting)
